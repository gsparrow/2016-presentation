DETAILS:

Applications are now being accepted for the Student Volunteers program at the SC16 conference to be held Nov. 13-18 in Salt Lake City.

SC16 is the premier international conference for high performance computing, networking, data storage and analysis.

As part of the Students@SC program, Student Volunteers play a key role in supporting the overall conference and conference attendees.

Undergraduate and graduate student volunteers help with the administration of the conference and have the opportunity to participate in student-oriented activities, including professional development workshops, technical talks by famous researchers and industry leaders, a job fair, exhibits by 350 organizations, as well as develop lasting peer connections.

For SC16, the Student Volunteers program will accept an increased number of students, both local and international, with the goal of transitioning students into the main conference by way of the Technical Program, Doctoral Showcase and Early Career professional development sessions.

Although limited financial support will be available to cover some travel costs, applicants will also need to ask their home institutions for help.

For details, go to: \\

The application deadline is Wednesday, June 1. \\
Applications must be submitted online at \\

For questions regarding the program, please email \\
